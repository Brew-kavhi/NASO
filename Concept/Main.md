# Concept of Masters thesis for pruning and neural architecture search of DNN

Basic concepts of a DNN: DNN is a deep neural network, that consists of linear layers. See more here: [DNN](DNN.md)

## Goal of this project?
Reduce a DNN in its complexity and enable it to be executed on small edge devices in realtime with low power consumption. Therefore we need to define a metric, that measures how good an algorithm is, see [Metric](Metric.md)
